# RUNNING OF THE AUTOMATED TEST SUIT
<br>

Eleven test case was designed and implemented for testing requested input fields of the selenium easy web page. 
Eight test cases have been passed, however, two test cases from the eleven have been failed due to the detected 
bug of the radio button input field of the page. The running time of the tests was 1:05 minutes on the chrome 
browser (Significantly longer running time was measured with their running on Firefox: 1:49 minutes)
